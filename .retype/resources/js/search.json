Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.","Input","The first line of the input contains two integers n and k(1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.","The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n(0 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a__i is the score earned by the participant who got the i_-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n- 1 the following condition is fulfilled: (a_i ≥ a_i + _1).","Output","Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.","Note","In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.","In the second example nobody got a positive score."]}],[{"l":"Petya and Strings","p":["Little Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.","Input","Each of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.","Output","If the first string is less than the second one, print -1. If the second string is less than the first one, print 1. If the strings are equal, print \"0\". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the strings are compared."]}]]
